This project is an HTML and CSS layout page created to practice front-end structure and styling. It includes a header with navigation links, a fixed contact button, a cover section, and an image grid built using CSS Grid. The footer contains developer, contact, location, and company information with hover effects for interaction. The project shows how page sections, layout systems, and basic styling come together to form a complete webpage.
